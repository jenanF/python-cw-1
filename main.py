# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
name = "jenan"
num1 = 3
num2 = 5
print(f" i am {name}, i have {num1 + num2} apples")

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / \

print(10/2)

# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *

print(num1*num2)

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it

length = 6

# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it

width = 6

# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`

area = width*length

# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable

print(f"The result is:  {area}")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f"If the length of a rectangle is {length}, and width is {width} then the area is: {area}")
